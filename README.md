# Box.io

**Box.io** is a project developed as part of the **CPSC 1045: Introduction to Web Programming** course. This course focused on JavaScript, and the assignment was to create a game using only vanilla JavaScriptâ€”no external libraries or frameworks.

## Game Overview

For this project, I designed a game inspired by the classic **Snake**, but with a unique twist. The focus is on **speedrunning** and **difficulty**, with the following key differences:

- **Timer-based gameplay**: The game ends when the timer runs out, rather than when you collide with your tail.
- **Simplified mechanics**: The traditional tail mechanics have been removed to streamline gameplay.
- **Local scoreboard**: A local leaderboard system is implemented using the browser's `localStorage`.

## Development Notes

While the game is functional, there are areas for improvement:

- **Code organization**: Functions and logic could be better separated into dedicated JavaScript files for improved maintainability.
- **Naming conventions**: Some function names lack clarity and could be more descriptive.
- **Code quality**: Refactoring and optimization could enhance readability and performance.

Despite these areas for improvement, the project successfully meets its goals and demonstrates core JavaScript skills.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
3. Start the game, race against the timer, and try to secure a top spot on the local leaderboard!

## Key Features

- **Pure JavaScript**: No external libraries or frameworks are used.
- **Local Leaderboard**: Scores are stored in `localStorage` for persistent tracking.
- **Focus on Speed and Skill**: Encourages quick reactions and precision.
